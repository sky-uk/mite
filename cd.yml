# Further ideas for jobs to run:
# - license check
# - make sure test coverage increases
# - merge all tox tests into one using pyenv
# And, once we're sure that the pipeline is working:
# - integration/performance tests
# Once we have docs:
# - documentation coverage
# - docs build (on master only)
