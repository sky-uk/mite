Why Mite?

The name Mite
-------------

*WIP*, We need to add the story of the name. 


Load Testing framework
----------------------

Mite is an open-source load testing framework with distributed components written in Python. Requests are executed asynchronously, allowing large throughput from relatively small infrastructure.
The philosophy driving the effort was simple:

1. **Scalability**:  The apps that we test are scalable, distributed systems;
   our performance testing framework should be as well.
2. **Maintainability**:  As software engineers, we have a full arsenal of
   information organization and reuse techniques.  We should treat our
   performance tests as code, and bring these same techniques to bear.
3. **Snakiness**:  Python is the best language for us to accomplish our
   goals for the project.


.. admonition:: NEED MORE
    :class: note

    *Need more on philosophy, on test as code and on being asynchronous*
