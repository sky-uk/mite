Mite documentation
==================

Mite is a performance testing framework created by the performance
testing in Sky UKÊ¼s Identity group.  The philosophy driving the effort
was simple:

1. **Scalability**:  The apps that we test are scalable, distributed systems;
   our performance testing framework should be as well.
2. **Maintainability**:  As software engineers, we have a full arsenal of
   information organization and reuse techniques.  We should treat our
   performance tests as code, and bring these same techniques to bear.
3. **Snakiness**:  Python is the best language for us to accomplish our
   goals for the project.
